# ReadyAPI

ReadyAPI is a PHP module to create REST API quickly

## Install

Import with Git :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Olafr9500/ReadyAPI.git <your Project>/api
```

And get the dependencies and build the autoload with Composer :

```bash
composer install
```

> The autoload will be done automatically via composer script.

## How to use it

> In your database, make sure each table has a primary key in the first position.

### Database class file

- Create an object in the folder **`database`** with the same name as your database. You can copy the file **`database/databaseSample.php`** and rename it.

- In the construct function, choose the host name, the database name and the identifiers

  ```php
  parent::__construct("<Name_Server>", "<Name_DataBase>", "<Username>", "<Password>");
  ```
  
  > _The connector type is defined in the extends of the database object._
  
  ```php
  class DatabaseSample extends DatabaseMySql
  ```

### Object class file

#### Added via script

> You must have added a database object before performing this method.

```bash
composer add <NameObject> <DatabaseName>
```

#### Added manually

- Create an object in the folder `object` with the same name as your table. You can copy the file **`object/sampleObject.php`** and rename it.
- Rename the object's class name to that of your table.

  ```php
  class SampleObject extends ObjectMySql
  ```

- Add for each column a public variable in the object.

  ```php
  public $variable1;
  public $variable2;
  public $variable3;
  ```

- In the construct function, add the table name, the list of all column names and the list of all new column.

  ```php
  parent::__construct($db, "sampleObject", ["id", "variable1", "variable2", "variable3"], ["id", "variable1", "variable2", "variable3"]);
  ```

  > _Leave "id" in the first position_
- Write the "isEmpty" and "isDataCorrect" functions so that they correspond to the specifics of your variables.

### CRUD folder

- Copy the folder **`sampleObjectMySql/`** and rename it with the name of your table.
- In each file of the folder, rename the calls of the file or of the sample class by that of your table.

  ```php
  include_once '../object/sampleObjectMySql.php';
  ...
  $sample = new SampleObject($database->conn);
  ```

### Make API secure less

- In the file **`config/static.php`**, change the `$SECURE_API` constant from true to false.

  ```php
  public static $SECURE_API = true;
  ```

### Build for autoload

- After writing your objects, build the application to take them into autoload.

  ```bash
  composer build
  ```
